## [CSS Combinators(]https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator)

Sometimes, we want need to use a more convoluted targeting method. ðŸ˜œ

- Adjacent sibling combinator `div + p`
- General sibling combinator `div ~ p`
- Child combinator `div > p`
- Descendant combinator `div p`

## CSS Pixels

- Your monitor is divided into pixels (screen pixels).
- When you write CSS, you specify the height, width and position in `px` units.

This `px` unit is **not** a screen pixel, but a CSS pixel.

It's approx. 1/96 inches, _but it varies from display to display._

Dave notes:

### Example of a Desktop site

<img src="./assets/nresp_desktop.png" />

---

The same site on a mobile device

<img src='./assets/nresp_mobile.png' />

---

## A Quick Fix?

Add the following to your HTML page(s)

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`

This will make the CSS pixels scale on mobile devices.


Dave Note - look up CSS Pixels?  Further reading?

The same site _fixed_

<img src='./assets/nresp_mobile_fix.png' />

DN - - This is not "responsive" but it's being scaled.

## [Responsive vs. Mobile-first](https://darwindigital.com/mobile-first-versus-responsive-web-design/)

DN - From a design perspective, start with Mobile first
You design for your biggest constraint 
---

<img src='./assets/responsive.png' />

---

<img src='./assets/mobile_first.png' />

---

### Responsive (pros)

- Good for heavily stacked information websites
- Easier for large forms and complex call-to-actions
- Cost-effective development and maintenance
- Great for SEO

---

### Responsive (cons)

- The mobile experience is not 100% optimized

---

### Mobile-First (pros)

- Better user-experience on mobile devices
- Majority of internet browsing in on a smartphone
- Design website to use built-in phone features
- Cheaper than building an iOS, Android or Hybrid App

---

### Mobile-First (cons)

- The desktop experience is not 100% optimized
- Not suited for content heavy websites

---

## So how do we implement these things?

## [Media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) ðŸ¥³

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

- width and height of the viewport
- width and height of the device
- orientation (landscape or portrait)
- resolution

---

### A basic media query

[Try it](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_mediaqueries_ex1)

so you use @media screen, and this gives you a condition 
(max width or min width)

So to do mobile first

Do mobile as default

Then do media min-width to do anuy stying with a screne that is *at least* 900px wide
or whatever you imagine a PC screen is.

6:20 - doing well so far.

500 px is a good middle point

Anything below 500 is mobile


1024 is smallest for desktop
